How To Play:

The Goal of the game is to avoid the path of light, and stay in the shadows. The A and D keys move the plate in counter-clockwise or clockwise rotations respectfully (note: you will be stationary when the game begins, so act fast!). The movement of the light will rotate in one of these directions as well, but it will switch at random!

Avoid the light, stay in the darkness, and prevent yourself from melting. Your score will increase as time goes on, and if you spend too much time in the light you will melt. Once completely melted, the game will end.

Changes From The Design Document:

Game would have been really really easy if could move completely in 2-D space, so I changed the movement options to force the player to move either clockwise or counter clockwise in order to keep up with the shadow.

Good / Bad / Ugly Code:

Bad code: I spent so long trying to do the good way of the shadow buffer read stuff and copped out for the angle-based implementation I made to test early on.

But I think it looks nice?


## Asset Build Instructions

The ```meshes/export-meshes.py``` script can write mesh data including a variety of attributes (e.g., *p*ositions, *n*ormals, *c*olors, *t*excoords) from a selected layer of a blend file:

```
blender --background --python meshes/export-meshes.py -- meshes/crates.blend:1 dist/crates.pnc
```

The ```meshes/export-scene.py``` script can write the transformation hierarchy of the scene from a selected layer of a blend file, and includes references to meshes (by name):

```
blender --background --python meshes/export-scene.py -- meshes/crates.blend:1 dist/crates.scene
```

The ```meshes/export-walkmeshes.py``` script can writes vertices, normals, and triangle indicies of all meshes on a selected layer of a .blend file:

```
blender --background --python meshes/export-walkmeshes.py -- meshes/crates.blend:3 dist/crates.walkmesh
```

There is a Makefile in the ```meshes``` directory with some example commands of this sort in it as well.

## Runtime Build Instructions

The runtime code has been set up to be built with [FT Jam](https://www.freetype.org/jam/).

### Getting Jam

For more information on Jam, see the [Jam Documentation](https://www.perforce.com/documentation/jam-documentation) page at Perforce, which includes both reference documentation and a getting started guide.

On unixish OSs, Jam is available from your package manager:
```
	brew install ftjam #on OSX
	apt get ftjam #on Debian-ish Linux
```

On Windows, you can get a binary [from sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ftjam/2.5.2/ftjam-2.5.2-win32.zip/download),
and put it somewhere in your `%PATH%`.
(Possibly: also set the `JAM_TOOLSET` variable to `VISUALC`.)

### Libraries

This code uses the [libSDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) library to create an OpenGL context, and the [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net) library for OpenGL-friendly matrix/vector types.
On MacOS and Linux, the code should work out-of-the-box if if you have these installed through your package manager.

If you are compiling on Windows or don't want to install these libraries globally there are pre-built library packages available in the
[kit-libs-linux](https://github.com/ixchow/kit-libs-linux),
[kit-libs-osx](https://github.com/ixchow/kit-libs-osx),
and [kit-libs-win](https://github.com/ixchow/kit-libs-win) repositories.
Simply clone into a subfolder and the build should work.

### Building

Open a terminal (or ```x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017``` on Windows), change to the directory containing this code, and type:

```
jam
```

That's it. You can use ```jam -jN``` to run ```N``` parallel jobs if you'd like; ```jam -q``` to instruct jam to quit after the first error; ```jam -dx``` to show commands being executed; or ```jam main.o``` to build a specific file (in this case, main.cpp).  ```jam -h``` will print help on additional options.
